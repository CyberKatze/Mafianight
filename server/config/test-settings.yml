database:
  # NOTE: By design, this setting prevents the SQLITE_DATABASE environment variable
  # from affecting test runs, so that we don't accidentally affect the
  # production database during testing. If you're not concerned about that and
  # would like to have environment variable overrides, you could instead use
  # something like:
  #
  #   database: "_env:SQLITE_DATABASE:haskell-web_test.sqlite3"
  jwt-secret: "_env:JWT_SECRET:secret"
  salt: "_env:SALT:secretsalty"
  database: mafia-db_test
  port:     "_env:YESOD_PGPORT_TEST:54321"
  # See config/test-settings.yml for an override during tests
  database: "_env:YESOD_PGDATABASE_TEST:mafia-db_test"
